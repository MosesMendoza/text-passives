Contributions are welcome. Areas that could use some love: build & deploy on
different versions of python/docker images, error handling, and more textblob
APIs supported. Please stick to proper http/REST semantics for proposed API
additions/changes. Open a PR if you want to add more! Only contributions that
include relevant test coverage will be accepted. I'm not a python expert so bear
with me.
